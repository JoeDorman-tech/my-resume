        <b>Kinematic Modelling of a Three-Axis Articulated Robotic Arm</b><br>
        Developed and validated the kinematic model of a three-degree-of-freedom articulated robotic arm for industrial applications. The design utilized CAD software, and forward and inverse kinematics were derived analytically using the Denavit-Hartenberg convention. Verified the model's accuracy and precision through MATLAB, RoboAnalyzer, and Fusion 360, demonstrating the arm’s ability to reach any position in its workspace with four possible configurations. <br>

        <b>FNN-Based Inverse Kinematics for Efficient Trajectory Planning in Industrial Robots</b><br>
        Investigated the use of Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs) for solving task-specific inverse kinematics of industrial robots, aiming to achieve high accuracy and rapid training. The ABB IRB 6700 robot was used as a case study. Performance was evaluated using ME, STD, and RMSE, showing reduced training times and accurate predictions. <br>
